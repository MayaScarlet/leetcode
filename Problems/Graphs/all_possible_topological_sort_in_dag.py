"""
Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG), print all its topological orderings.

Algorithm:
The idea remains similar to Kahnâ€™s topological sort, where we find vertices with no incoming edges and removing all
outgoing edges from these vertices.
We build all possible orderings from left to right, where the vertices with in-degree zero become candidates for
the next vertex. We can do this using backtracking, where the graph state is restored after processing the selected vertex.
