You are given the root of a binary search tree(BST), where exactly two nodes were swapped by mistake.
Fix (or correct) the BST by swapping them back. Do not change the structure of the tree.
Note: It is guaranteed that the given input will form BST, except for 2 nodes that will be wrong.
All changes must be reflected in the original linked list.

Example 1:
Input:
       10
     /    \
    5      8
   / \
  2   20
Output: 1
