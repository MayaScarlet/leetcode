Given a binary tree with a value associated with each node, we need to choose a subset of these nodes
such that sum of chosen nodes is maximum under a constraint that no two chosen node in subset
should be directly connected that is, if we have taken a node in our sum then we canâ€™t take it's
any children or parents in consideration and vice versa

Input:
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    /     /  \
   4     5    6
Output: 16
Explanation: The maximum sum is sum of
nodes 1 4 5 6 , i.e 16. These nodes are
non adjacent
