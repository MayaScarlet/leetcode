"""
Given an integer array representing preorder traversal of a binary tree, and a boolean array that determines if the value
at the corresponding index in the preorder sequence is a leaf node or an internal node, construct and return the full binary tree.
A full binary tree is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.

Input:

preorder[] = [1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 8, 9, 7]
isLeaf[]   = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]	 (1 represents a leaf node, and 0 represents an internal node)
