Given a binary tree and an integer K. Find the number of paths in the tree which have their sum equal to K.
A path may start from any node and end at any node in the downward direction.


Example 1:

Input:
Tree =
        1
      /   \
    2      3

K = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
Path 1 : 1 + 2 = 3
Path 2 : only leaf node 3
